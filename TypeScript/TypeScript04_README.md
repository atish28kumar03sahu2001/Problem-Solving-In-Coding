# TypeScript05 Problem Solving


## Question

Input: 14	Output: Even	Input: 23	Output: Odd

## Answer

1. In this code we are giving `number` type argument to the function to calculate whether the number is even or odd.

2. In Function we can observe that the function is returning `String` type. So after checking the number is even or odd it will return the string values in output.
