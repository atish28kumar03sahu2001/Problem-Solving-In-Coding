# TypeScript02 Problem Solving


## Question

Create a program that print the phrase "Hello TypeScript"

## Answer

1. In this code we create a function with void return type so that it will print the value when we call the particular function.

2. In TypeScript during function creation we have to mention the data type also so that it will give or return that type of output only.
